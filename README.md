# Your Future App

This project aims to help new developers to decide what App types and characters people prefer. The goal was achieved by making Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction models on the Google Play Store Apps dataset. I worked on a dataset found through the Kaggle website. I used python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Sklearn, and Matplotlib.

By Applying EDA the following questions will be answered:

-	Which category has more Apps?
-	To which Installs label the maximum installs Apps belongs?
-	Who is the developer who has the maximum number of Apps?
-	Will the price affect number of installations?
-	What is the most downloaded app?
-	What is the most famous category of the app?
