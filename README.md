# Google Play Store Apps

This project aims to make Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction models on the Google Play Store Apps dataset. These EDA and models will help the developers to understand the type of application people preferred. I worked on a dataset founded through the Kaggle website. I used python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

By Applying EDA the following questions will be answered:

* Will the price affect number of installations?
* What is the most downloaded app?
* What is the most famous category of the app?
